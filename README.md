# 1. Application Purpose & User Value
This is a one-page, interactive web application built with Bootstrap 5 to serve as a hub for mental health awareness resources. The site offers users easy access to 3 grid-based cards, each containing informative content on mental health topics.

**User Value:**
*   **Accessibility:** The design prioritizes accessibility, ensuring all users can engage with the content, including those with disabilities.
*   **Responsiveness:** The site is fully responsive, providing a consistent and optimal viewing experience across all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
*   **Structured Content:** The use of clear headers and a grid layout makes it easy for users to find and browse information.

## 2. Front-End Design & UX
*   **Layout:** A single-page layout with a sticky navigation bar that links to different sections, allowing for quick navigation without leaving the page.
*   **Visuals:** The use of calming colors (blues and light tones) and image placeholders promotes a positive user experience.
*   **Cards:** Each card presents a distinct mental health topic, with a clear heading and a "Read More" button that can be linked to external articles.
*   **Headers:** Semantic `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` tags are used to create a clear content hierarchy, aiding screen readers and search engines.
*   **Feedback:** Interactive elements, such as hover effects on cards and buttons, provide immediate visual feedback to the user.

## 3. Code Validation & Accessibility
*   **HTML/CSS Validation:** The code has been checked against W3C standards to ensure it is clean and error-free.
*   **Accessibility (WCAG):** The design incorporates best practices:
    *   **Colour Contrast:** Colors are chosen to ensure sufficient contrast for readability.
    *   **Semantic HTML:** Tags like `<main>`, `<header>`, and `<nav>` provide meaningful structure.
    *   **Alt Text:** All `<img>` tags include descriptive `alt` text.
    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** Interactive elements are accessible via keyboard, and focus states are clearly visible.

## 4. Deployment Procedure
This site is built for easy deployment to any cloud hosting platform.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    `git clone [your-github-repo-url]`
2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    `cd mental-health-awareness`
3.  **Upload to Cloud Platform:**
    Upload the `index.html` and `style.css` files to your hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages).

## 5. AI in the Development Process
**5.1 Code Creation:** AI tools were used to generate the initial Bootstrap grid structure and placeholder card examples, significantly accelerating the layout creation phase. The core HTML and CSS were then refined manually to ensure project requirements were met.
**5.2 Debugging:** AI was instrumental in identifying minor syntax errors and optimizing CSS for better performance, such as ensuring a consistent box model across elements.
**5.3 Optimization:** AI assisted in suggesting accessibility improvements, such as the addition of a "skip to main content" link and the fine-tuning of color contrast to meet WCAG guidelines.
**5.4 Reflection:** The use of AI streamlined the development process, allowing for quicker implementation of boilerplate code. This enabled a greater focus on refining the user experience and ensuring adherence to accessibility standards.
